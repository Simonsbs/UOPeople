    Encapsulation is a really interesting and important principle in OOP (Object
    Oriented Programming). It helps developers build modular, reusable code but
    also helps promote and add a security layer to the code. This also helps
    ensure the data integrity of the objects we design by only allowing access
    to the parts we want and how we want.
  </p>

  <p dir="ltr">
    At its core, encapsulation is all about bundling functions, methods,
    properties and fields into a single object defined in a class item. The
    functions and methods in the code itself control access to the different
    parts of the class object. for instance, a class that defines a Student
    might have a "firstName" and "lastName" variable stored in it but to modify
    the values in those variables we only allow access via a function called
    "updateFullName" which verifies that the name provided adhere to the
    standards and rules set by the application business logic.
  </p>

  <p dir="ltr">
    Access control is a key tool when dealing with encapsulation and is done by
    using the access modifiers:
  </p>

  <ul type="disc">
    <li dir="ltr">
      Private - Allows access only from within&nbsp; the scope of the class
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
      Public - Allows access from anywhere, inside or outside the class scope
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
      Protected - represents a middle ground between private and public allowing
      access from inheriting classes in the same package but blocking access
      from outside the package.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p dir="ltr">
    These modifiers allow us to control what parts and data are accessible in
    our object from both within our package and from outside access. An example
    would be a "BankAccount" object that might set the "deposit" and “withdraw”
    (or any other getter or setter) methods as public while the variable that
    stores the current bank account balance is safely controlled and protected
    using the private modifier. This way we can fully control the flow of data
    going into and out of our variable. This is very important when we later
    reach a point when thread safety and transactions come into play. It's also
    important to note that even with the access modifier we would still want to
    add code verification and user authentication.
  </p>

  <p dir="ltr">
    When we use encapsulation properly we can help ourselves by building code
    that is both secure and less prone to bugs and issues. And also the code
    becomes much easier to reuse in future projects. For instance, we can build
    a strong and reliable base class that has all types of functions and
    features such as user authentication, build it once and re-use it throughout
    our project and possibly even other projects.
  </p>

  <p dir="ltr">
    In conclusion, when you think of encapsulation you need to keep in mind the
    following: code organization, data integrity, security, maintainable code,
    and reusability. Making it a crucial part of programming and should be
    considered throughout all of the development stages.
