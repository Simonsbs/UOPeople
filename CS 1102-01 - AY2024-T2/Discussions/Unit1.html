      <h4>Variables and data types</h4>
      <p>
        In Java, as in most programming languages variables and datatypes are
        the building blocks of programming. Variables act as storage for for
        data kind of like little boxes. while data types represent the type of
        data we can put in the box. Java has two types of data:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Primitive</strong><br />these include: Numeric, Character, and
          Boolean types.<br />where the data is the value required to be stored.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reference</strong><br />these are objects and arrays which
          unlike primitive types instead of storing the value in the variable we
          store the memory address to the actual data which is stored elsewhere.
          this allows us also to reference and access the same object from
          multiple variables.
        </li>
      </ol>
      Its important to use and understand each of the types and where it is best
      to use each one, since using for example a data type of long where a data
      type of int is sufficient is a waste of system memory and resources.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Operator precedence</h4>
      <p>
        This dictates how the order in which Java evaluates commands and
        equations. its important that we make sure we understand the order of
        execution since we my expect a result but receive something else. for
        instance:<br />
      </p>
      <pre><span style="color:rgb(239,69,64);">int res = 10 + 3 * 2; // res = 16</span></pre>
      we may have wanted to first add the 10 and the 3 and only after that
      multiply by 2, but since multiplication is of higher order it is executed
      first.<br />So if for instance we did want to change the order we could
      add parenthesis around the part we want executed first. this would make
      that part higher ordered and execute first.<br /><br />
      <pre><span style="color:rgb(239,69,64);">int res = (10 + 3) * 2; // res = 26</span></pre>
      So now we see that understanding the order of execution and how we can
      change the order can help us understand and make sure that the result we
      want and the result we get are the same.

      <h4>Significance and Applications of Conditionals in Java</h4>
      Conditionals are one of the most basic tools in programming they allow us
      to transform our code from a one dimensional flow of code into a complex
      multi-branched code tree that executes different code in different
      conditions resulting in different results.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>If-Else<br /></strong>the most common conditional command,
          executes blocks of code based on the result of a condition where one
          block is executed if the condition is true or a second (optional)
          block is executed if the condition is false. for example:<br />
          <pre><span style="color:rgb(239,69,64);">int score = 50;
if (score &gt; 50) {
	System.out.println("Pass");
} else {
	System.out.println("Fail");
}</span></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Switch case<br /></strong>Best used when we have a condition
          that is dependant on the value of a single variable.it's more readable
          when we have multiple scenarios for a single variable since each is
          represented by a single case. for example:<br /><br />
          <pre><span style="color:rgb(239,69,64);">int dayOfWeek = 3;
String message;

switch (dayOfWeek) {
	case 1:
		message = "Monday: Start of a new week!";
		break;
	case 2:
		message = "Tuesday: Keep going!";
		break;
	case 3:
		message = "Wednesday: Halfway through!";
		break;
	case 4:
		message = "Thursday: Almost there!";
		break;
	case 5:
		message = "Friday: Weekend is near!";
		break;
	case 6:
		message = "Saturday: Enjoy the weekend!";
		break;
	case 7:
		message = "Sunday: Rest day!";
		break;
	default:
		message = "Invalid day: Please enter a number between 1 and 7.";
}
System.out.println(message);</span></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ternary</strong><br />A short hand for the if-else condition
          helps us make our code more compact and readable in some cases. here
          we too present a condition and if it is true the first part of the
          code is used (a) and if the condition is false the second part is used
          (b). this is very useful when we want to condition the value of a
          variable on a condition.<br />For example:&nbsp;<br />
          <pre><span style="color:rgb(239,69,64);">int result = (a &gt; b) ? a : b;
</span>
</pre>
          <br />
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
