    In Java, static and non-static methods and variables are fundamental
    concepts that define how data and methods belong to either the class itself
    or to instances of the class. This distinction has significant implications
    for how objects are created, accessed, and managed in memory.<br />
  </p>
  <h4>Static Methods and Variables:</h4>
  <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left">
    Static methods and variables are associated with the class itself rather
    than any specific instance. This means they can be accessed directly using
    the class name without needing an instance of the class.
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr"></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Use Cases: </strong>Static methods are commonly used for utility
      and/or helper functions that do not require any object state backing them.
      For example, The built in 'Math.max()' method is static because it does
      not rely on any instance variables. Static variables are often used for
      constants or shared data across all instances, such as a counter to track
      the number of instances created.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Advantages: </strong>The main advantage of static methods and
      variables is that they are managed better in memory since they are created
      once at the start of the program and exist for the life of the program.
      They also enhance code organization by encapsulating functionality that
      does not require an object state.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Limitations: </strong>A significant limitation of static elements
      is their inability to access instance methods and variables directly. This
      can lead to less flexible code as static methods cannot be overridden in
      the same way as instance methods, potentially limiting polymorphism.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left">
    For example, consider a class Counter:<br />
  </p>
  <pre style="text-align: left">
public class Counter {
    public static int count = 0; // Static variable

    public static void incrementCount() { // Static method
        count++;
    }
}
</pre
  >
  <p>
    In the example above, count and incrementCount() are static. They can be
    accessed without creating an instance of Counter:
  </p>
  <pre>Counter.incrementCount();
System.out.println(Counter.count); // Outputs: 1<br></pre>
  <h4>Non-Static (Instance) Methods and Variables:</h4>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 0.9375rem"
      >On the other hand, we have non-static variables and
      methods.&nbsp;Non-static elements belong to an instance of the class. Each
      instance has its copy.</span
    >
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Use Cases: </strong>Instance methods perform operations that are
      relevant to the current state and value of an object. For instance, the
      built-in 'toString()' method uses the instance data to provide a string
      representation of the object. Instance variables store data unique to each
      object, such as a name field in a Dog class.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Advantages: </strong>The primary advantage of non-static elements
      is their ability to access both static and non-static members of the
      class. This allows for more flexible code, allowing object-oriented
      principles like encapsulation and inheritance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Limitations: </strong>The downside of instance methods and
      variables is that they consume more memory. Since each object instance has
      its copies of these variables, leading to increased memory usage compared
      to static variables.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 0.9375rem">For example, Consider a class Dog:</span
    ><br />
  </p>
  <pre>public class Dog {
    public String name; // Instance variable

    public Dog(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void display() { // Instance method
        System.out.println("Woof!, My Name Is: " + name);
    }
}<span style="font-size:15px;white-space:normal;">
</span></pre>
  <p>
    Each Dog object has its name. Accessing these requires an object
    instance:<br />
  </p>
  <pre>Dog d1 = new Dog("Rex");
Dog d2 = new Dog("Fido");

d1.display(); // Outputs: Woof!, My Name Is: Rex
d2.display(); // Outputs: Woof!, My Name Is: Fido<span style="font-size:15px;white-space:normal;">
</span></pre>
  <p>
    Static elements are more memory-efficient for shared data. For example, if
    we want to count the number of Employee instances, we might use a static
    counter:<br />
  </p>
  <pre>public class Cat {
    private static int catCount = 0;

    public Cat() {
        catCount++;
    }

    public static int getCount() {
        return catCount;
    }
}<span style="font-size:15px;white-space:normal;">
</span></pre>
  <p>
    Here, catCount is static and shared across all instances. Every time a new
    Cat is created, this count is incremented:<br />
  </p>
  <pre>new Cat();
new Cat();
System.out.println(Cat.getCount()); // Outputs: 2<span style="font-size:15px;white-space:normal;">
</span></pre>
  <p>
    On the other hand, non-static elements are essential for maintaining data
    specific to each object. For instance, each Cat has its unique name, so the
    name should be non-static.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In summary, static elements are suitable for shared data and utility
    functions, while non-static elements are essential for object-specific
    states, values, and behaviours. Using them effectively involves
    understanding these distinctions and applying them appropriately in
    different scenarios. So, the choice between static and non-static elements
    depends on the specific requirements of the application.
